# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
In this project we have been tasked to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid the paid Amazon Vine Program.  The Amazon Vine Program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to recieve reviews for thier products.  Companies pay a small fee to Amazone and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. Using PySpark to perform the ETL process on video game data, we will extract the dataset, transform the data into pgAdmin.  Then using PySpark and Pandas to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
